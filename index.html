        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a lifelong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island" target="_blank">Rhode Islander</a> who loves living by the water. In the warmer months you'll find me there, by the water, spending time with my family or out on my SUP board.</p>
        <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. I've been playing acoustic guitar and bass for over 20 years, and also dabble in electric guitar and piano. I play bass in <a href="https://beyondgravityband.com" target="_blank">Beyond Gravity</a>, a '90s alt-rock band. Playing live keeps me connected to the music I love in a really meaningful way.</p>
        <p>Before working in tech, I was a full-time carpenter and the love of the craft never left me. I've renovated kitchens and bathrooms, replaced windows and siding, built outdoor furniture, and still take on most of my home projects myself.</p>
        <p>I'm also an avid reader, a runner, and an amateur gardener. In contrast to my career in software most of my hobbies live in the physical world, from growing food to playing music to building things with my hands.</p>
        <p>Of all the things in my life, my greatest joy comes from being a husband to an amazing wife and a dad to two great kids. They keep me grounded and fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Professionally, I'm in software. I've been with <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com" target="_blank">Constant Contact</a> for over 15 years. I started on the ground floor in support and worked my way up to Sr. Principal Template Engineer. I'm completely self/community taught, and I enjoy working in the email space; especially at the intersection where code, design, and user experience meet. I proudly wear the <a href="https://email.geeks.chat" target="_blank">#EmailGeek</a> badge and love being part of a community that's always rising to a new challenge and evolving.</p>
