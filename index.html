        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Professionally, I’m in software. I’ve been with <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/" target="_blank">Constant Contact</a> for over 15 years. I started on the ground floor in support and worked my way up to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewdionne/" target="_blank">Sr. Principal Template Engineer</a>. I’m completely self- and community-taught, and I enjoy working in the email space; especially at the intersection of code, design, and user experience. I proudly wear the <a href="https://email.geeks.chat/" target="_blank">#EmailGeek</a> badge and love being part of a community that’s always evolving and rising to new challenges.</p>
        <p>In contrast to my digital career, most of my hobbies live in the physical world: growing food, playing live music, building things with my hands, or getting outside for a run or paddle.</p>
        <p>As a lifelong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island" target="_blank">Rhode Islander</a> I love being by the water. In the warmer months, you’ll find me at the ocean, bay, or river, spending time with my family or out on my SUP board.</p>
        <p>Before working in tech, I was a full-time carpenter, and that love of the craft never left me. I’ve renovated kitchens and bathrooms, replaced windows and siding, built outdoor projects, and still take on most home projects myself.</p>
        <p>Music has always been another huge part of my life. I’ve been playing acoustic guitar and bass for over 20 years and also dabble in electric guitar and piano. I play bass in <a href="https://beyondgravityband.com" target="_blank">Beyond Gravity</a>, a ’90s alt-rock band. Playing live keeps me connected to my love of music in a meaningful way.</p>
        <p>I'm also an <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/mattdionne" target="_blank">avid reader</a>, a <a href="https://strava.app.link/Mz387580yWb" target="_blank">runner</a>, and an amateur gardener.</p>
        <p>But of all the things in my life, my greatest joy comes from being a husband to an amazing wife and a dad to two great kids. They keep me grounded and wholly fulfilled. ♥️</p>
